# IT-PROG Project: Phase 2—Administrator's Dashboard

A user interface for modifying the [combo meal ordering system](https://github.com/ronnparcia/itprog-phase1-flask)'s (Phase 1) list of menu items and combos, and generating daily summary reports.

The project specifications required that this application must use PHP, MySQL, and XML.

## General Instructions

Before running either the Phase 1 or Phase 2 application, import the `db_machineproject.sql` database to **phpMyAdmin** or your MySQL Server. Both Phase 1 and Phase 2 use the same database.

1. Copy the `phase2` folder (or its contents to a new folder) to XAMMP's `htdocs` folder.
2. Make sure the **PHP** and **MySQL** services are running on your machine.
3. The application begins with the `login-form.php` file. To access the web application in your web browser, enter the path to this file—based on where you saved the project folder in Step 1 (e.g. `localhost/phase2/login-form.php`).
4. You may login using any username and password in the `tbl_accounts` table in the `db_machineproject` database.
5. To begin fast, you may use the following account:

> **Username:** `rparcia`<br>
**Password:** `par1234`
